# FischBracketSolver
Using the Patented Kyle Fischer Bracket Algorithm. You can get an accurate and great bracket for the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament

# Variables
- Team Name
- Team Rank
- Overall Weight - Can be whatever, I use 20 to represent all teams plus a bit of chance
- Big Ten Bias - how much extra chance a big ten team should get


## How to use
1. Enter your big ten bias 

2. Enter the name of team 1

3. Ent1er the rank of team 1

4. Enter the name of team 2

5. Enter the rank of team 2

6. Output the winner

## The Algorithm
If Team is Purdue, Purdue Wins!

If Team is Big Ten, subtract bias from rank

Take Weight and subtract rank and bias from it.

Get total of both teams chance to win

Get a random number between 1 and the total

if random number is in Team1's range (Its weight and rank combination): Team 1 wins

Else: Team 2 wins



## Times it has been Completely Accurate ~0/10.
